3.3.4.4.10   Rate change, titration, Bolus from existing infusion, and Multistep
3.3.4.4.10.1 Rate change or titration
ORC-1 Order Control = “XO”.
RXG-5 Give Amount-Minimum and RXG-7 Give Units must be empty.
RXG-15, 16 must contain a rate or dose rate and cannot contain a dose.


3.3.4.4.10.2 Bolus from existing infusion
Considerations:
* An infusion is currently programmed on the pump.
* A bolus of the same medication is ordered (i.e. there is a new order in the EHR).  
* The EHR workflow provides the nurse the capability to administer the bolus from the same bag or syringe using the PIV PCD-03 transaction to send the bolus order to the pump.
* No assumption is made about the behavior of the pump once the bolus has been delivered.  Depending on the pump type or model it may stop, alarm, or resume delivering the underlying infusion.


ORC segment
* ORC-1 Order Control = “CH” (change)
* ORC-2 Placer Order Number = bolus order ID (child order ID)
* ORC-8 Parent = parent order ID


A bolus order may be specified in 3 ways:
* Dose or Volume + Rate
* Dose or Volume + Duration
* Rate + Duration
The following table outlines the required and optional data for each type of bolus order.
Bolus order type
	ORC-1
	ORC-2
	ORC-8
	RXG-15/16
	TQ1 segment
	OBX segment with OBX-5 = MDCX_INFUSION_PROGRAM_TYPE = clinician-dose
	OBX segment with OBX-5 = MDC_FLOW_FLUID_PUMP
	Dose or volume + rate
	“CH”
	Bolus  (child) order ID
	Parent order ID
	Dose or volume amount

OBX segment
* Include an OBX segment specifying the order type of bolus (clinician dose) where
OBX-5 = MDCX_INFUSION_ORDER_TYPE.  This term has enumerations “clinician-dose”, “loading-dose”, and “continuous”.
* When RXG-15 and RXG-16 specify a dose, include an OBX segment specifying the rate where OBX-5 = MDC_FLOW_FLUID_PUMP.


When the IPEC or DEC profiles contain information about a bolus from an existing infusion, note that the PCD-01 and PCD-10 messages contain bolus information in the Clinician Dose Info section.
In the OBR segment, OBR-2 Placer Order Number contains the order ID of the bolus as a “child” order ID.  OBR-29 Parent is used to contain the order ID for the parent (i.e. the existing infusion).  


3.3.4.4.10.3 Multistep
The ordered medication and concentration must be identical in all steps.
All steps are represented in the BCMA by a single order and a single order ID.
Some pump models may support different dosing units (RXG-15 and 16) among steps (see Example 2 in the PCD TF vol 1, Section 4.4).


PCD-03 message structure
When used for multistep the HL7 RGV message structure used by PIV will require repetition of certain segments resulting in some duplication.  
The simplified message structure for multistep is shown below.  
{} indicates repetition, [] indicates optionality.
 
MSH
PID
[PV1]
ORC
{
RXG
[TQ1]
RXR
OBX (multiple)
}


Each step must contain:
* Step number in RXG-1 (values are 1...n)
* An OBX segment to indicate the type of the current step
   * OBX-3 = MDCX_INFUS_ORDER_STEP_TYPE
   * enumerations are  "loading dose" or "continuous"
   * “loading dose” is optional and supported in step 1 only
* An OBX segment to indicate the total number of steps in the program
   * OBX-3 = MDCX_INFUS_TOTAL_NUM_STEPS
* Additional OBX segments containing the pump ID or patient parameters (e.g. height, weight, BSA) as required


The following table applies to how data is provided in PCD-01 and PCD-10 messages when the IPEC or DEC profiles are used for a multistep infusion.
