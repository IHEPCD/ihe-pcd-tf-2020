	Rationale for Change:
Adding support for the EHR to program a bolus order when an infusion for the same medication is currently programmed and confirmed on an infusion pump.  
This will extend the PIV profile to support this common use case
	 


Bolus from an existing infusion  
Considerations:
* An infusion is currently programmed on the pump.
* A bolus of the same medication is ordered (i.e. there is a new order in the EHR).  
* The EHR workflow provides the nurse the capability to administer the bolus from the same bag or syringe using the PIV PCD-03 transaction to send the bolus order to the pump.
* No assumption is made about the behavior of the pump once the bolus has been delivered.  Depending on the pump type or model it may stop, alarm, or resume delivering the underlying infusion.


ORC segment
* ORC-1 Order Control = “CH” (change)
* ORC-2 Placer Order Number = bolus order ID (child order ID)
* ORC-8 Parent = parent order ID


A bolus order may be specified in 3 ways:
* Dose or Volume + Rate
* Dose or Volume + Duration
* Rate + Duration
The following table outlines the required and optional data for each type of bolus order.
Bolus order type
	ORC-1
	ORC-2
	ORC-8
	RXG-15/16
	TQ1 segment

OBX segment
* Include an OBX segment specifying the order type of bolus (clinician dose) where
OBX-5 = MDCX_INFUSION_ORDER_TYPE.  This term has enumerations “clinician-dose”, “loading-dose”, and “continuous”.
* When RXG-15 and RXG-16 specify a dose, include an OBX segment specifying the rate where OBX-5 = MDC_FLOW_FLUID_PUMP.


When the IPEC or DEC profiles contain information about a bolus from an existing infusion, note that the PCD-01 and PCD-10 messages contain bolus information in the Clinician Dose Info section.
In the OBR segment, OBR-2 Placer Order Number contains the order ID of the bolus as a “child” order ID.  OBR-29 Parent is used to contain the order ID for the parent (i.e. the existing infusion).

3.3.4.4.9 OBX - Observation/Result segment
Refer to HL7 v2.6: Section 7.4.2x 
The HL7 OBX segment is used to transmit a single observation or observation fragment. In the 
Point-of-Care Infusion Verification Profile the usage is limited to providing: 
1. pump ID 
2. patient parameters such as height, weight, or body surface area (BSA)
3. infusion order type
34. other parameters used to program the pump. 
Note that the definition of the OBX segment in this profile is constrained from the definition used in the PCD Observation/Result Message to reflect this limited usage. The broader definition can be found in OBX - Observation/Result segment, Appendix Section B-8. 
One OBX segment containing the pump ID must always be present. Additional OBX segments containing patient parameters, infusion order type, or pump programming parameters may optionally follow.


  





OBX-2 Value Type
The PCD PIV Profile constrains this field as follows: 
If OBX-3 refers to a pump ID this field must be empty. 
If OBX-3 refers to a patient parameter that conveys a numeric quantity (e.g., patient weight), this value is restricted to NM. 
If OBX-3 refers to an infusion order type this field must be “ST”.
If OBX-3 refers to a pump programming parameter, this value should identify the data type of the value in OBX-5 Observation Value. 


OBX-3 Observation Identifier 
The PCD PIV Profile constrains the value of this field to one of the following: 
Pump ID 
69986^MDC_DEV_PUMP_INFUS_VMD^MDC
Patient parameter 
68063^MDC_ATTR_PT_WEIGHT^MDC 
68060^MDC_ATTR_PT_HEIGHT^MDC 
188744^MDC_AREA_BODY_SURF_ACTUAL^MDC
Pump programming parameter 
157985^MDC_DOSE_PCA_LIMIT^MDC 
157986^MDC_VOL_PCA_DOSE_LIMIT^MDC 
157987^MDC_TIME_PD_PCA_DOSE_LIMIT^MDC
157988^MDC_RATE_PCA_MAX_DOSES_PER_HOUR^MDC 
157989^MDC_TIME_PCA_LOCKOUT^MDC 
157994^MDC_VOL_FLUID_CONTAINER_START^MDC 
0158017^MDC_DOSE_PCA_PATIENT^MDC 
0158019^MDC_DOSE_CLINICIAN^MDC
0158018^MDC_DOSE_LOADING^MDC 
0^MDCX_INFUS_ORDER_TYPE^MDC
(Note: Code  assignment assignments for last three terms are pending as of publication date) 


OBX-4 Observation Sub-ID 
The PC PIV Profile does not further constrain this field.


OBX-5 Observation Value 
If OBX-3 refers to a pump ID, this field must be empty. 
If OBX-3 refers to a patient parameter, this field contains the parameter value. 
If OBX-3 refers to an infusion order type, this field contains the enumerated value. 
If OBX-3 refers to a pump programming parameter, this field contains the parameter value.


OBX-6 Units 
The PCD PIV Profile constrains the value of this field based on the value in OBX-3. 
If OBX-3 refers to a pump ID, this field must be empty. 
If OBX-3 refers to a patient parameter, this field contains the coded units for the parameter. The preferred format is an MDC value; UCUM values are also acceptable.
When OBX-3 refers to weight, the first three components of OBX-6 must contain one of the following sets of values: 
263872^MDC_DIM_X_G^MDC 
263875^MDC_DIM_KILO_G^MDC 
g^g^UCUM
kg^kg^UCUM 
When OBX-3 refers to height, the first three components of OBX-6 must contain one of the following sets of values: 
263441^MDC_DIM_CENTI_M^MDC 
cm^cm^UCUM
When OBX-3 refers to BSA, the first three components of OBX-6 must contain one of the following sets of values: 
263616^ MDC_DIM_SQ_X_M^MDC 
m2^m2^UCUM 
If OBX-3 refers to an infusion order type, this field must be empty.
If OBX-3 refers to a pump programming parameter, this field contains the units for the value in OBX-5 Observation Value.

ORC-1 Order Control   
Definition: Determines the function of the order segment. The PCD TF requires that this field be valued as RE, or XO or CH according to the table below when the RGV^O15^RGV_O15 Pharmacy/Treatment Give Message is used to send information from the Infusion Order Programmer (IOP) to the Infusion Order Consumer (IOC).

ORC-8 Parent (EIP) 00222 
Components: <Placer Assigned Identifier (EI)> ^ <Filler Assigned Identifier (EI)> 
Subcomponents for Placer Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)> 
Subcomponents for Filler Assigned Identifier (EI): <Entity Identifier (ST)> & <Namespace ID (IS)> & <Universal ID (ST)> & <Universal ID Type (ID)> 
Definition: This field relates a child to its parent when a parent-child relationship exists. The parent-child mechanism is described under HL7 Table 0119 - Order control codes . 
The first component has the same format as ORC-2-placer order number (Section 4.5.1.2, "Placer Order Number (EI) 00216"). The second component has the same format as ORC-3-filler order number 4.5.1.3Filler Order Number (Section , "(EI) 00217"). The components of the placer order number and the filler order number are transmitted in sub-components of the two components of this field. 
ORC-8-parent is the same as OBR-29-parent. If the parent is not present in the ORC, it must be present in the associated OBR. (This rule is the same for other identical fields in the ORC and OBR and promotes upward and ASTM compatibility.) This is particularly important when results are transmitted in an ORU message. In this case, the ORC is not required and the identifying filler order number must be present in the OBR segments.
